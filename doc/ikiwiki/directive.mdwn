Directives are similar to a [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]] in form, except they
begin with `!` and may contain parameters. The general form is:

	\[[!directive param="value" param="value"]]

This gets expanded before the rest of the page is processed, and can be used
to transform the page in various ways.

The quotes around values can be omitted if the value is a simple word.
Also, some directives may use parameters without values, for example:

	\[[!tag foo]]

A directive does not need to all be on one line, it can be
wrapped to multiple lines if you like:
	
	\[[!directive foo="baldersnatch"
	bar="supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" baz=11]]

Also, multiple lines of *quoted* text can be used for a value.
To allow quote marks inside the quoted text, delimit the block
of text with triple-double-quotes or triple-single-quotes:

	\[[!directive text="""
	1. "foo"
	2. "bar"
	3. "baz"
	""" othertext='''
	1. 'quux'
	2. "foo"
	''']]

If you want to put text with triple quotes into a parameter value, you can
use perl-style here-doc syntax, even nesting it like this:

	\[[!directive text=<<OUTER
	[[!otherdirective <<INNER
	inner text
	INNER]]
	outer text
	OUTER]]

ikiwiki also has an older syntax for directives, which requires a space in
directives to distinguish them from [[wikilinks|ikiwiki/wikilink]]. This
syntax has several disadvantages: it requires a space after directives with
no parameters (such as `\[[pagecount ]]`), and it prohibits spaces in
[[wikilinks|ikiwiki/wikilink]].  ikiwiki now provides the `!`-prefixed
syntax shown above as default.  However, ikiwiki still supports wikis using
the older syntax, if the `prefix_directives` option is disabled.
