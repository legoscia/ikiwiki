Jeremy, what about OpenID users? Do they also have Preferences?
I don't use openid plugin in my ikiwiki, so I can't check
whether OpenID users are stored in .ikiwiki/userdb file. --[[Paweł|ptecza]]

I would be quite interested in inheriting a banned users list from ikiwiki.  More generally, the ikiwiki community might benefit from sharing ban lists amongst each other.  Some way to achieve that as part of the existing work/data flows (git pulls etc.) would be interesting.  That might require defining banned users in other places than just the setup file, though. -- [[Jon]]
