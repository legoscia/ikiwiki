[[!tag type/tags type/link]]

This plugin provides the [[ikiwiki/directive/tag]] and 
[[ikiwiki/directive/taglink]] [[directives|ikiwiki/directive]].
These directives allow tagging pages.

It also provides the `tagged()` [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]], which can be used to
match pages that are tagged with a specific tag.

The `tagbase` setting can be used to make tags default to being put in a
particular subdirectory.

The `tag_autocreate` setting can be used to control whether new tag pages
are created as needed. It defaults to being done only if a `tagbase` is
set.

The `tag_autocreate_commit` setting is enabled by default, and causes
new tag pages to be checked into version control.

[[!if test="enabled(tag)" then="""
This wiki has the tag plugin enabled, so you'll see a note below that this
page is tagged with the "tags" tag.
