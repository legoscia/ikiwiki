It would be very cool if this plugin was enabled by default.  One of the best ways to learn how to do various advanced things is to be able to "view source" on other wiki's which do things you like.  -- [[AdamShand]]

This plugin requires the cgi plugin.  If you run a static site, you may check the [[repolist]] plugin.  -- [[weakish]]
