This plugin allows editing of Discussion pages, and posting of comments,
even when the [[lockedit]] plugin has been configured to otherwise prevent
editing.

Like the [[plugins/anonok]] plugin, this plugin allows anonymous edits
and comments, so be prepared to deal with comment spam;
the [[plugins/moderatedcomments]] and [[plugins/blogspam]] plugins might
be useful to reduce this.
