The theme plugin allows easily applying a theme to your wiki, by
configuring the `theme` setting in the setup file with the name of a theme
to use. The themes you can choose from are all subdirectories, typically
inside `/usr/share/ikiwiki/themes/`.

A theme provides, via the underlay, an enhanced version of the regular
[[style.css]]. This leaves [[local.css]] free for you to further
customise. Themes can also provide header and background images.

You can set the theme via the **theme** option in your config file (after
enabling the plugin). Refresh the wiki after changing it to see the changes.
