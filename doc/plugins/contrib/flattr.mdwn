[flattr.com](http://flattr.com/) is a flatrate micropayment service, which revolves around the idea of having flattr buttons everywhere that people visiting your site can use to "flattr" you.

This plugin makes it easier to put flattr buttons in ikiwiki. It supports both the static kind as well as the counting dynamic javascript version. The dynamic version does not work if [[htmlscrubber|/plugins/htmlscrubber]] is active on the page.

The dynamic button does not require creation of the page on flattr before being added to a page, the static one does.

I wrote some notes on [jonatan.walck.se](http://jonatan.walck.se/software/ikiwiki/plugin/flattr/) and put the source here: [flattr.pm](http://jonatan.walck.se/software/ikiwiki/flattr.pm)

This plugin is licensed under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (public domain).

Note that there is now a [[plugins/flattr]] plugin bundled with ikiwiki. It
is less configurable, not supporting static buttons, but simpler to use.
