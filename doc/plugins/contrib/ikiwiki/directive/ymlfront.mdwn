The `ymlfront` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/contrib/ymlfront desc=ymlfront]] plugin.

This directive allows the user to define arbitrary meta-data in YAML format.

    \[[!ymlfront data="""
     foo: fooness
     bar: The Royal Pigeon
     baz: 2
     """]]

There is one argument to this directive.

* **data:**
  The YAML-format data.  This should be enclosed inside triple-quotes to preserve the data correctly.

If more than one ymlfront directive is given per page, the result is undefined.
Likewise, it is inadvisable to try to mix the non-directive ymlfront format with the directive form of the data.
