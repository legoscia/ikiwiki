> It is fairly common terminology amoung all version control systems to use
> "working copy" to refer to a checkout from version control, including
> copies of all the versioned files, and whatever VCS-specific cruft that
> entails. So, a working copy is everything you get when you `git clone`
> a repository. --[[Joey]]
