# NAME

ikiwiki-makerepo - check an ikiwiki srcdir into revision control

# SYNOPSIS

ikiwiki-makerepo git|svn|monotone|darcs|cvs srcdir repository

ikiwiki-makerepo bzr|mercurial srcdir

# DESCRIPTION

`ikiwiki-makerepo` injects a `srcdir` directory, containing an ikiwiki wiki,
into a `repository` that it creates. The repository can be created using
any of a variety of revision control systems.

Note that for mercurial and bzr, the srcdir is converted into a
repository. There is no need to have a separate repository with mercurial
or bzr.

For darcs, the master repo's apply hook will be preconfigured to call a
ikiwiki wrapper.

Note that for monotone, you are assumed to already have run "mtn genkey"
to generate a key.


# EXAMPLE 

`ikiwiki-makerepo git /var/www/wiki /home/user/wiki/`

The above command creates a new git repo in /home/user/wiki as well as a new git repo in the /var/www/wiki directory. 
It then initializes the /home/user/wiki git repo and makes the /var/www/wiki a clone.
