With the current HEAD (b10d353490197b576ef7bf2e8bf8016039efbd2d),
globbing in `tagged()` pagespecs doesn't work for me.  For example,
`tagged(*)` doesn't match any pages.  (It does in this wiki installation
here, though.)

I did not yet do any testing to figure out when this broke.

--[[tschwinge]]

[[!map pages="*/a* and tagged(*ose)"]]

>> Yes, it is a globbing issue:

>>     \[[!map pages="tagged(open_i*ue_gdb)" show=title]]

>> ... doesn't show anything.

>>     \[[!map pages="tagged(open_issue_gdb)" show=title]]

>> ... does show a map of eight pages.  Also, it's working fine on the

>>> Only way I can reproduce something like this is if tagbase is not set.
>>> I have fixed a bug there, see if it works for you?
