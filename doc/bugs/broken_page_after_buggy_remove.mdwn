Hi, I created \[[sandbox/subpage]] then I deleted it with the "remove" button.
After confirmation there was a message about a xapian error (My bad, I did not write down the exact error message).
Now, accessing [[sandbox/subpage|sandbox/subpage]] leads my browser complains about a redirect loop. [[JeanPrivat]]
>Uh. Now the bug of redirect loop seems to have solved itself. However, I don't know if the xapian error need to be investigated. But I found another [[bug|cannot revert page deletion]]. [[JeanPrivat]]
