I'd like a way to always ask the RCS (Git) to update a file's mtime in
refresh mode.  This is currently only done on the first build, and later
for `--gettime --rebuild`.  But always rebuilding is too heavy-weight for
this use-case.  My options are to either manually set the mtime before
refreshing, or to have ikiwiki do it at command.  I used to do the
former, but would now like the latter, as ikiwiki now generally does this
timestamp handling.

From a quick look, the code in `IkiWiki/Render.pm:find_new_files` is
relevant: `if (! $pagemtime{$page}) { [...]`.

How would you like to tackle this?
