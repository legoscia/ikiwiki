I'm often confused about permissions and I wish ikiwiki could stamp it's foot down and ensure all the permissions are correctly (canonically?) setup.

I keep ending up having to `sudo chown -R :www-data` and `sudo chmod -R g+w` on srcdir, destdir. I'm never quite sure what is the best practice for the srcdirs' `/srv/git/` is. Currently everything looks like `hendry:www-data` with ug+rw.

I think I've triggered these problems by (not thinking and) running `ikiwiki --rebuild --setup /home/hendry/.ikiwiki/mywiki.setup` as my user.

I don't know if there can be some lookup with `/etc/ikiwiki/wikilist`.  Though shouldn't everything be under the `www-data` group in reality?

Also when I use `sudo ikiwiki -setup /etc/ikiwiki/auto.setup`, I think I create a ton of problems for myself since everything is created as the root user, right? And `/etc/ikiwiki/wikilist` doesn't seem to have the latest created wiki added. I have to reluctantly manually do this.
