I am trying to do an !inline and sort the pages after meta(date)

	\[[!inline pages="blog/* and !*/Discussion" sort="meta(date)" show="0" rootpage="blog" archive="yes"]]

There are a few pages inside blog/* and I would like to give the !meta line as example for two of them:

page 1: blog/get_http.mdwn

	\[[!meta title="HTTP GET method" date="2010-09-17 00:00:00"]]

page 2: blog/nagios.mdwn

	\[[!meta title="Nagios 3" date="2010-09-09 00:00:00"]]

page 3: blog/using_macos.mdwn

	\[[!meta title="How I am using Mac OS X" date="2010-06-10 00:00:00"]]

The ordering which is created can be seen at <http://www.michael-hammer.at/blog_all> and is 

page 1 -> page 3 -> page 2

which is obviously not correct. I can say that the ordering is regardless of the sort="" argument inside !inline done by the ctime. This is really annoying as ctime is hard to recover if one has to move the blog from one machine to another.

- What am I doing wrong? 
- Is this a bug? If not: Why is meta(date) ignored?
