The text of comments (and other internal pages) does not get indexed by the
search plugin.

Search indexes content passed to the postscan hook.
Comments are inlined, but inline's speed hack avoids adding inlined
content to the page until the format hook.

And hmm, that's somewhat desirable, because we don't want searches
to find content that is inlined onto another page.

That suggests that the fix could be to call the postscan hook
for internal pages. 

However, the search postscan hook tells xapian the page url,
and uses `urlto($page)` to do it. And that won't work for
an internal page. Guess it could be modified to tell xapian the
permalink. --[[Joey]]
