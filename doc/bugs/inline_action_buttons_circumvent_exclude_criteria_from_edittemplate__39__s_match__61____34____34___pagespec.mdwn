If I instruct editemplate to only match the top level pages in a directory using 

    match="foo/* and !foo/*/* and !foo/*/*/*"

everything works as expected for pages created via links on other wiki pages. So, if I open foo/bar (or any other page on the wiki) and create a link to foo/bar/bug, edittemplate appropriately does not insert any text into the new page. 

However, if I use an inline directive like the following 

    !inline pages="page(foo/bar/*)" rootpage="foo/bar" postform=yes actions=yes

every page created via the action buttons incorrectly pulls in the text from the edittemplate registration. Changing the order of the conditions in the match="" pagespec has no impact.
