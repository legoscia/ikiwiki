Commit 3650d0265bc501219bc6d5cd4fa91a6b6ecd793a seems to have been caused by
a bug in ikiwiki. recentchanges/* was added to the git repo incorrectly.

Part of the problem seems to be that git's `rcs_commit` does a git add followed
by a `rcs_commit_staged`, and so calling `rcs_commit` on files that were
not checked in before adds them, incorrectly.

I'm unsure yet why the recentchanges files were being committed. Possibly
because of the link fixup code run when renaming a page. --[[Joey]]
