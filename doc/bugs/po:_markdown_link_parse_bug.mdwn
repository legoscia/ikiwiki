Apparently this is legal markdown, though unusual syntax for a link:

	[Branchable](http://www.branchable.com/ "Ikiwiki hosting") 

If that is put on a translatable page, the translations display it not as a
link, but as plain text.

Probably a po4a bug, but I don't see the bug clearly in the gernerated po
file:

	"This was posted automatically by [Branchable](http://www.branchable.com/ "
	"\"Ikiwiki hosting\") when I signed up."
