I'd like the more plugin and RSS to play better together. In the case of the html generation of the main page of a blog, I'd like to get the first paragraph out, but keep RSS as a full feed.

Maybe there is a different plugin (I also tried toggle)?

I also note, that at least currently, more seems to break on a few pages, not being parsed at all when aggregated into the front page.
