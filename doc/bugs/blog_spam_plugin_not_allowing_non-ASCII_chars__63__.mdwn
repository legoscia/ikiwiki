Hi,

I'm trying to add a comment, and ikiwiki fails with this error message:

    Error: HTTP::Message content must be bytes at /usr/share/perl5/RPC/XML/Client.pm line 308

This seems to happen because I had a non-ASCII character in the comment (an ellipse, â€¦).
The interesting part is that the comment preview works fine, just the save fails. Probably
this means that the blogspam plugin is the culprit (hence the error in RPC::XML::Client library).
I'm using version 3.20100815~bpo50+. Thanks!
