I have perl 5.10.0. Ikiwiki 2.44 compiles fine. Compiling 2.45 fails after 'make':

    perl -Iblib/lib   ikiwiki.out -libdir . -setup docwiki.setup -refresh
    refreshing wiki..

OK, this is what I'm getting:

    $ perl -Iblib/lib -V
    @INC:
    blib/lib
    /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.10.0
    /usr/share/perl5/site_perl/5.10.0
    /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl
    /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl
    /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl
    /usr/lib/perl5/core_perl
    /usr/share/perl5/core_perl
    /usr/lib/perl5/current
    /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/current

I ran the following in my current 2.45 source dir, where the `make` already succeded. If you need it, I can post the output
in the case where `make` fails.

    $ strace perl -Iblib/lib -e 'use IkiWiki' 2>&1 |grep IkiWiki.pm
    stat64("blib/lib/IkiWiki.pmc", 0xbfa6167c) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    stat64("blib/lib/IkiWiki.pm", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0444, st_size=31901, ...}) = 0
    open("blib/lib/IkiWiki.pm", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 3

> I need to see it in the case where it's failing. --[[Joey]]

I finally had some time to look into this again.

I wiped ikiwiki off my system, and then installed version 2.41. I tried installing
2.46 and get the same error as above, so I'll be using 2.46 below. (BTW, the debian
page still lists 2.45 as current; I had to fiddle with the download link to get 2.46).

After running `./Makefile.PL` I get:

    $ perl -Iblib/lib -V
    [bunch of lines snipped]
      @INC:
    blib/lib
    [bunch of paths snipped]

Running the strace:

    $ strace perl -Iblib/lib -e 'use IkiWiki' 2>&1 |grep IkiWiki.pm

I get a bunch of ENOENTs and then at the end:

    stat64("./IkiWiki.pmc", 0xbfa2fe5c)     = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    stat64("./IkiWiki.pm", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=31987, ...}) = 0
    open("./IkiWiki.pm", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 3

After running `make` (and having it fail as described above):

    $ strace perl -Iblib/lib -e 'use IkiWiki' 2>&1 |grep IkiWiki.pm
    stat64("blib/lib/IkiWiki.pmc", 0xbfd7999c) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    stat64("blib/lib/IkiWiki.pm", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0444, st_size=31901, ...}) = 0
    open("blib/lib/IkiWiki.pm", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 3

I don't know what is going on, but I'll run any more tests you need me to.

I have 2.46 installed and I can reproduce the bug reported against 2.49. The command that fails is:

    $ /usr/bin/perl -Iblib/lib   ikiwiki.out -libdir . -setup docwiki.setup -refresh
    docwiki.setup: Failed to load plugin IkiWiki::Plugin::inline: Too many arguments for IkiWiki::htmlize at IkiWiki/Plugin/inline.pm line 359, near "))"
    Compilation failed in require at (eval 14) line 2.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 14) line 2.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 10) line 21.

strace -f produces a 112K file. I don't know enough to be comfortable analyzing it.
However, lines like:

    stat64("/usr/local/share/perl5/site_perl/5.10.0/IkiWiki.pm", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0444, st_size=31982, ...}) = 0

make me think the make process is not completely independent of a previous
installation. Joey, should I email you the strace log file?

Joey, thanks for your time and effort looking into this.

I checked with `which`: `perl` is indeed `/usr/bin/perl`. The commands fail similarly when
calling `perl` and `/usr/bin/perl`.

However, you might be into something with your `libdir` idea. If I remove it from the
command line, the command succeeds. In other words, if I run

    perl -Iblib/lib   ikiwiki.out -setup docwiki.setup -refresh

then it works perfectly.

By the way, I'm running Arch linux. The perl build script is a bit long, but I
see they install a patch to modify @INC: <http://repos.archlinux.org/viewvc.cgi/perl/repos/core-i686/perl-5.10.0-archlinux-inc-order.patch?revision=1&view=markup>

Would you suggest I try rebuilding perl without this patch? Debian has a huge perl patch (102K!);
it's not straightforward for me to see if they do something similar to Arch.

> I think Debian has a similar patch.

[[done]] -- apparently this was a problem due to a distribution's
customisation to perl, or something. Seems to late now to track down what,
unfortunatly. And ikiwiki's Makefile no longer uses the "-libdir" switch
that seemed to trigger the bug. --[[Joey]]
