When I set up my picture page with `\[[!img  defaults size=300x]]` then the html validator complains that the value for height is missing and the IE browsers won't show the pictures up at all; no problems with ff tho. If I set up my picture page with `\[[!img  defaults size=300x300]]` then all the images are funny stretched. What am I doing wrong?
