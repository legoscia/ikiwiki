When building ikiwiki in the background, having a --quiet which will only
report errors would be nice. -- RichiH

>> Correct, which means it's not quite quiet:

    % ikiwiki --setup foo --rebuild
    generating wrappers..
    successfully generated foo
    successfully generated foo
    rebuilding wiki..
    scanning [...]
    [...]
    building [...]
    [...]
    done

Yes, I can simply redirect the output, but an option would be cleaner, imo. -- Richard

> The output above looks like verbose mode output to me (the scanning/building lines, at least).  Check you haven't enabled it in your setup file by accident. I get the following:

    $ ikiwiki --setup setup
    successfully generated [cgi]
    successfully generated [post-update]
    skipping bad filename [...]
