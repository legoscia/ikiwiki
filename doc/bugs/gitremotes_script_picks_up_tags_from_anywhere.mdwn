[[!tag patch]]
[[!template id=gitbranch branch=smcv/ready/no-tags author="[[smcv]]"]]

The `gitremotes` script picks up tags from any repository, including those
used for local .debs that were never actually present in Debian:

    smcv@reptile% git tag | grep -c nmu
    52

This can be avoided with the `tagopt = --no-tags` option in .git/config;
see <http://git.pseudorandom.co.uk/smcv/ikiwiki.git?a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/ready/no-tags>

> *done* thanks. Also cleared propigated tags out of origin. 
> 
> Hmm, in testing I still see tags get pulled the first time a remote
> is added. If those are then locally deleted, it doesn't pull them again
> with the `--no-tags`.
