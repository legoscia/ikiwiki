If I try to authenticate using openid to my site, it tries to create a http or https connection to the openid server. This doesn't work, because the direct connection is blocked by the firewall.

It would be good if ikiwiki supported setting up a proxy server to solve this.

I have found if I add:

    newenviron[i++]="HTTPS_PROXY=http://host.domain.com:3128";

to IkiWiki/Wrapper.pm it solves the problem for https requests, however it obviously would be preferred if the proxy name is not hard coded.

Also, the ability to set HTTPS\_CA\_FILE and HTTPS\_CA\_DIR might benefit some people. Then again, it I can't see any evidence that the SSL certificate of the server is being checked. See the [[bug_report|ssl_certificates_not_checked_with_openid]] I filed on this separate issue.

Unfortunately, HTTP\_PROXY doesn't work for http requests, it looks like that library is different.

Update 2008-10-26:

Better solution, one that works for both http and https, and uses config options. It appears to work...

Note that using $ua->proxy(['https'], ...); won't work, you get a "Not Implemented" error, see <http://community.activestate.com/forum-topic/lwp-https-requests-proxy>. Also see [[!debbug 129528]].

Also note that the proxy won't work with liblwpx-paranoidagent-perl, I had to remove liblwpx-paranoidagent-perl first.
