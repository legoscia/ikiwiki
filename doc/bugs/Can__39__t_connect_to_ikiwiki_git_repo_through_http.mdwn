When I try to clone or pull the ikiwiki repo via the http interface described on the [[git]] page,
I get the following error message:

    fatal: http://git.ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki.git/info/refs not found: did you run git update-server-info on the server?

Using the "git" interface still works, but I can't access that through a firewall.

Also, clicking on the "gitweb" link gets me to the front page of ikiwiki.info, not the gitweb page.
