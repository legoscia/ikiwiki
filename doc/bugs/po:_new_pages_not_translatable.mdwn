Today I added a new English page to l10n.ikiwiki.info. When I saved,
the page did not have the translation links at the top. I waited until
the po plugin had, in the background, created the po files, and refreshed;
still did not see the translation links. Only when I touched the page
source and refreshed did it finally add the translation links. 
I can reproduce this bug in a test site. --[[Joey]]
