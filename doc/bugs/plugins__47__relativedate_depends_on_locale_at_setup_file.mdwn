[[plugins/relativedate]] does not works when russian locale defined at setup file (locale => 'ru_RU.UTF-8'). This is happen because javascript for this plugin takes either elements title or content itself. If russian locale is turned on then title generated on russian language and JS can't convert it into Date object. innerHTML is language independent (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm) always.

If I switch locale to en_US.UTF-8 then this plugin correctly parses text date and print relative date. But when I mouseover on date I see unusual formating of the date (it uses AM/PM format while russians use 24-h notation).

P.S. All pages but RecentChanges show well-formated date. RecentChanges show date formated using locale. Anyway, plugin does not work without en_US locale.
