If I browse <http://ikiwiki.info> in [emacs-w3m](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/emacs-w3m) (without Javascript), I
can't do a [[search|plugins/search]]: the text field is there (so I can
enter my search request), but there seems to be no way to make
actually a search request (i.e., no button). 

(A remark on how it works now in the other browsers: 
In the more "complete"
browsers (Chromium etc.), the request is done by pressing Enter in the
text field.)

I see, no Javascript is probably involved in using the search form;
the code is simply:

    <form method="get" action="/ikiwiki.cgi" id="searchform">
    <div>
    <input type="text" id="searchbox" name="P" value="" size="16"
     />
     </div>
     </form>

So, if the semantics suggested by HTML is such that such a form is to
be submitted by some default form submitting action in the UI and it
doesn't really require a button to be functional, then I'd say it's
not an ikiwiki's problem, but a missing feature in the UI of emacs-w3m
or the underlying w3m... Perhaps I'll report this issue to them. --Ivan Z.

There is no problem at all!
I'm sorry for this hassle!
In emacs-w3m, there is the <code>w3m-submit-form</code> command
(<kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>) to submit the form at point; it works.--Ivan Z.
