I enabled multimarkdown to make use of footnotes in my file. I have the multimarkdown plugin,
as well as the command-line program. If I write a document with footnotes:

    This line has a footnote[^1]
    
    [^1]: this is the footnote

and compile it from the cli, the reference becomes a link to the footnote and the footnote
gets a backreferencing link appended. When compiled in ikiwiki with the goodstuff plugin
enabled, the links are created but their hrefs are empty (so they do not actually act as links).
Disabling the htmlscrubber plugin fixes this issue

[[!tag multimarkdown htmlscrubber]]

> href was of the form: #fnref:1 , scrubbed by overzealous protocol
> scrubbing.
