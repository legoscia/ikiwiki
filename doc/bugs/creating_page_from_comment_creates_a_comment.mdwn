If a comment contains a WikiLink, for a page that doesn't exist, and the
user clicks on the edit link, and creates the page, it will itself be saved
as a comment, with "._comment" extension.

This is very surprising and wrong behavior. The page editor tries to
preserve the linking page's format type, but it shouldn't do so if the page
is an internal page. --[[Joey]]
