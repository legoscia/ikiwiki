On [[ikiwiki/directive/img/]] I read that

> You can also pass alt, title, class, align, id, hspace, and vspace

but when I pass `class="myclass"` to an img directive, I obtain

    <img class="myclass img" ...

I found that this behaviour was added in commit f6db10d:

> img: Add a margin around images displayed by this directive.

which adds to img.pm:
    
    if (exists $params{class}) {
            $params{class}.=" img";
    }
    else {
            $params{class}="img";
    }

I would prefer if the `img` class were only added if no class attribute is
passed.

If you keep the current behaviour, please document it.
