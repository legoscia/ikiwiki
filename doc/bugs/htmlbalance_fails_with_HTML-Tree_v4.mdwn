[[!tag patch]]

My one-patch htmlbalance branch fixes incompatibility with HTML::Tree 4.0.
From the git commit:

    The HTML::Tree changelog says:
    
        [THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE OR TESTS]
        ...
        * Attribute names are now validated in as_XML and invalid names will
          cause an error.
    
    and indeed the regression tests do get an error.
