Ikiwiki's preprocessor parser cannot deal with arbitrary nested preprocesor
directives. It's possible to nest a directive with single quoted values
inside a triple-quoted value of a directive, but that's all.

It's not possible to unambiguously parse nested quotes, so to support
nesting, a new syntax would be needed. Maybe something xml-like?
