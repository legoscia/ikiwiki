[[!tag wishlist]]

It would be nice if ikiwiki, particularly [[plugins/comments]]
(but also, ideally, recentchanges) supported user avatar icons.

Idea is to add a directive that displays a small avatar image for a user.
Pass it a user's the email address, openid, username, or the md5 hash
of their email address:

	\[[!avatar user@example.com]]
	\[[!avatar http://joey.kitenet.net/]]
	\[[!avatar user]]
	\[[!avatar hash]]

These directives can then be hand-inserted onto pages, or more likely,
included in eg, a comment post via a template.

An optional second parameter can be included, containing additional
options to pass in the 
[gravatar url](http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/url).
For example, this asks for a smaller gravatar, and if a user does
not have a gravatar, uses a cute auto-generated "wavatar" avatar.

	\[[!gravatar user@example.com "size=40&default=wavatar"]]

The `gravitar_options` setting in the setup file can be used to
specify additional options to pass. So for example if you want
to use wavatars everywhere, set it to "default=wavatar".
