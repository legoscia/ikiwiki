When I added or edited a page, no commit message was written out (Mercurial backend, though I guess it shouldn't matter). This was done for e.g. the `rename` plugin. I made a naive but seemingly working change to `editpage.pm` to add a message.

I modeled the message on `rename.pm`, which used a lowercase initial letter and imperative form of the verb. This is not the case for e.g. the `comment` plugin, which says "Added a comment: ", so I guess there is no strict rule on style in this case.

>> I use the Mercurial backend, and Mercurial doesn't allow empty commit messages, so if there were no message, it would default to "no message given" (hardcoded in `mercurial.pm`), which is also clutter, and non-descriptive at that. But I'm on board with your reasoning. It's a matter of taste (and somewhat backend), I guess. I might continue to locally use this patch (with the caveat below fixed when commit message is given), but I won't push for it to be included upstream. --[[Daniel Andersson]]
