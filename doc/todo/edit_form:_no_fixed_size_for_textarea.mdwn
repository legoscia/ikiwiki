At the moment the text area in the edit form has a fixed size of 20 rows.

On longer pages its not very comfortable to edit pages with such a small box. The whole screen size should be used instead([example](http://img3.imagebanana.com/img/bl10u9mb/editingtodo_1241804460828.png)).

>>>>>> the javascript approach would need to work something like this: you need to know about the "bottom-most" item on the edit page, and get a handle for that object in the DOM. You can then obtain the absolute position height-wise of this element and the absolute position of the bottom of the window to determine the pixel-difference. Then, you set the height of the textarea to (current height in px) + determined-value. This needs to be re-triggered on various resize events, at least for the window and probably for other elements too. I may have a stab at this at some point. -- [[Jon]]

Google chrome has a completly elegant fix for this problem: All textareas
have a small resize handle in a corner, that can be dragged around. No
nasty javascript needed. IMHO, this is the right solution, and I hope other
browsers emulate it. [[done]]

Wouldn't it be possible to just implement an integer-valued setting for this, accessible via the "Setup" wiki page? This would require a wiki regen, but such a setting would not be changed frequently I suppose. Also, Mediawiki has this implemented as a per-user setting (two settings, actually, -- number of rows and columns of the edit area); such a per-user setting would be the best possible implementation, but I'm not sure if ikiwiki already supports per-user settings. Please consider implementing this as the current 20 rows is a great PITA for any non-trivial page.

> I don't think it would need a wiki rebuild, as the textarea is generated dynamically by the CGI when you perform a CGI action, and (as far as I know) is not cooked into any static content. -- [[Jon]]

	#editcontent {
