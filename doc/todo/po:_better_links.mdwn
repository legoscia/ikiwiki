Once the fix to
[[bugs/pagetitle_function_does_not_respect_meta_titles]] from
[[intrigeri]]'s `meta` branch is merged into ikiwiki upstream, the
generated links' text will be optionally based on the page titles set
with the [[meta|plugins/meta]] plugin, and will thus be translatable.
It will also allow displaying the translation status in links to slave
pages. Both were implemented, and reverted in commit
ea753782b222bf4ba2fb4683b6363afdd9055b64, which should be reverted
once [[intrigeri]]'s `meta` branch is merged.

An integration branch, called `meta-po`, merges [[intrigeri]]'s `po`
and `meta` branches, and thus has this additional features.
