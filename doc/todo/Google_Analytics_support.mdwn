I've extended the google plugin to add support for Google Analytics.
This is done in two steps:

* a `google_sitesearch` config option is introduced, to allow disabling
  sitesearch even when the `google` plugin is loaded
* a `google_analytics_account` config option is introduced. When it's
  defined, its value is assumed to be a Google Analytics account ID
  and the corresponding JavaScript code is automatically inserted in all
  documents. The way this is done is shamelessy stolen from the flattr
  plugin

Well, my idea was to put all Google-related functionality (in the sense
of support for any service provided by Google) into the google plugin.
The alternative would have been to have one separate plugin per feature,
but that doesn't sound particularly nice to me. I can split it in a
separate plugin if you believe it's cleaner that way

Yes, and so would flattr. But precisely because this kind of code would require
editing page.tmpl, doing it the manual way carries the burden of keeping it in
sync across Ikiwiki updates (I'm sure I don't need to mention the number of
help requests that essentially boil down to "oops, I was using custom templates
and hadn't updated them").
