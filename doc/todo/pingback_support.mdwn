A "pingback" is a system whereby URLs you might reference in a blog post are
contacted by the blog publishing software at publishing time (i.e., once) so
that they might update a list of "pingbacks" to the URL. The originating
URL's blog software might then display a list of pingbacks, or an excerpt of
the text from your blog, perhaps interleaved with comments, etc.

At a technical level, external URLs are extracted from your blog post by the
blogging software, fetched, inspected for information to determine whether the
remote server is configured to support pingbacks (look for link tags, or HTTP
headers) and the relevant pingback URL sent an XML-RPC packet.

There are other technologies to achieve the same thing: trackbacks predate
pingbacks but are more vulnerable to spam due to design problems.

The spec for pingbacks is at <http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback>.

I would like to somehow use pingbacks in conjunction with ikiwiki. I suppose
this could be achieved using a commit hook and some external software in which
case I will consider this done with an entry in [[tips]]; otherwise a
[[plugins|plugin]] to implement pingbacks would be great.
