Hi all. I upgraded the [ikiwiki-nav plugin](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2968)
so that now it supports:

  * Jumping to the file corresponding to the wikilink under the cursor.
  * Creating the file corresponding to the wikilink under the cursor (including
  directories if necessary.)
  * Jumping to the previous/next wikilink in the current file.
  * Autocomplete link names.

Download it from [here](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2968)

I've also created a new page unifying all the hints available here to use vim
with ikiwiki files, in [[tips/vim_and_ikiwiki]]
