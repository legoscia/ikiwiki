I'd like to have the wiki name appear in page titles as in "WikiName:
Page Title."  If I use `<TMPL_VAR WIKINAME>: <TMPL_VAR TITLE>` in the
template this works for all pages except the index page itself which
will have title "WikiName: WikiName" as its title.  Does anyone know
of a template-based solution to this or do I need to write a plugin
that provides a `IS_HOMEPAGE` template variable? --[[JasonBlevins]]
