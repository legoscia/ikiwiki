OK, this is not really a ikiwiki problem... but ikiwiki makes wiki clones
really easy to setup, and this is related to having a website cloned at
different places and pulling from the servers which are online.

My setup is like this: I have a server at home and another at my dorm
which will serve as a wiki clone. Each of them has a dynamic IP with DynDNS
set up. Now the problem lies in linking my domain to these two DynDNS addresses.
Multiple CNAMEs are not supported, and I don't know if there's any utility
which can update the A records on the DNS to point directly point to the
two separate IPs.
