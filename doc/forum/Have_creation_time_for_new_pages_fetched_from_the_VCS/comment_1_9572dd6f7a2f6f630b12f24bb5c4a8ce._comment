This is not done for reasons of speed. `rcs_getctime` is for many VCSs still slow, requiring a new svn or whatever to be forked off (and in the case of svn, possibly make a network connection). In the case where a commit comes in that adds multiple pages, that would be a lot of work. And for the VCSs where it's not slow, it manages to not be slow by optimising for the case where *all* the times for all pages are looked up in one go .. which is still rather a lot to do when only a single new page has been added. So we lose either way, and it's not suitable for being run all the time, unfortunately.
