I want to create a helpful welcome page http://pyjs.org/wiki/ mainly by using links or listings of what is called \"special pages\" in MediaWiki. (Currently, we have a list of all wiki articles, this frightens new readers.)

Can I somehow list all tags of the wiki, or is there a tag cloud?
How can I list the first level of subpages (not the pages, just the \"hierarchy\" level or so)?
What other \"special\" lists or so can ikiwiki generate (e.g. users, tags, changes, ...)?

Thanks for any help or directions!
