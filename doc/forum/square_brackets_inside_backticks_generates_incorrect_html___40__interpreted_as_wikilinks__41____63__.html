the following markdown code
`foo \[["bar"]]` generates the following output:

foo <span class="createlink"><a href="http://euler/~dabd/wiki/ikiwiki.cgi?page=__34__bar__34__&amp;from=foo&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>&#34;bar&#34;</span>

Perhaps this is a bug in the markdown processor?

<blockquote>
This has nothing to do with markdown; wikilinks and directives
are not part of markdown, and just get expanded to html before
markdown processing.

There is a bug open about this:
[[bugs/wiki_links_still_processed_inside_code_blocks]]

Note that escaping the wikilink with a slash will avoid it being expanded
to html.
