I'd already had a look at this idea before you posted this suggestion, and I ran into difficulties.
So far as I can see, it makes most sense to use the mechanisms already in place for editing pages, and enhance them.
Unfortunately, the whole edit-page setup expects a template file (by default, when editing pages, editpage.tmpl)
and anything apart from \"submit\" buttons must have a placeholder in the template file, or it doesn't get displayed at all in the form.
At least, that's what I've found - I could be mistaken.

But if it's true, that rather puts the kybosh on dynamically generated forms, so far as I can see.
I mean, if you knew beforehand what all your fields were going to be, you could make a copy of editpage.tmpl, add in your fields where you want, and then make a plugin that uses that template instead of editpage.tmpl, but that's very limited.

If someone could come up with a way of making dynamic forms, that would solve the problem, but I've come up against a brick wall myself.  Joey?  Anyone?
