I just have the following in my nginx config, which isn't as friendly, I think, as a 404 plugin, but it does the job: 

        location / {
            index  index.html index.htm;
            if (!-d $request_filename) {
               rewrite ^/(.*)/$ /ikiwiki.cgi?page=$1&do=create last;
               rewrite ^(.*)/$ /$1.html last;
               rewrite ^(.*)/$ /$1.htm last;
            }
            if (!-e $request_filename) {
               rewrite ^/(.*)$ /ikiwiki.cgi?page=$1&do=create last;
               rewrite ^(.*)$ $1.html last;
               rewrite ^(.*)$ $1.htm last;
            }
        }
