The 404 plugin relies on environment variables set by Apache for 404 handlers. Not all web servers set the same variables (404 handlers aren't a standard feature) so it might need adapting to support nginx. (lighttpd has a similer problem - it doesn't indicate that the request was a 404 in an obvious way.)

If you temporarily set this (shell!) CGI script as your 404 handler, its output should indicate what variables nginx sets:

    #!/bin/sh
    printf \"Content-type: text/plain\r\n\r\n\"
    env
