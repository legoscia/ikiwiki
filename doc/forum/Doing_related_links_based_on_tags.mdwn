I've been recently using a template this

    ----
    Related posts:

    \[[!inline pages="blog/posts/*
            and !blog/posts/*/*
            and !Discussion
            and !tagged(draft)
            and <TMPL_VAR raw_tagged>"
            archive="yes"
            quick="yes"
            show="5"]]

Which I then call by doing this at the end of my blog posts on my
ikiwiki install

    \[[!tag software linux]]
    \[[!template id=related tagged="tagged(software) or tagged(linux)"]]

It somewhat works, I was wondering if anyone else has tried to do
something like the above to get "related posts" based on tags. The way
that I have done it isn't very clever as it only links to the last 5
most recently posted items based on my parameters. Is it possible to
"randomly" select a bunch of links from a set of user defined
pagespecs?

I know that the [[backlinks]] plugin exists for this sort of stuff
(related links), it just lacks some user configuration options.

> I guess what you need is an extension to [[ikiwiki/pagespec/sorting]] to support "random" as a sort method.  Remember though, that the chosen few would only change when the page was regenerated, not on every page view. -- [[Jon]]
