I am thinking of adding pagination to the [[plugins/contrib/report]] plugin, but I'm not sure which is the best approach to take. (By "pagination" I mean breaking up a report into multiple pages with N entries per page.)

Approaches:

1. generate additional HTML files on the fly which are placed in the sub-directory for the page the report is on.  These are not "pages", they are not under revision control, they aren't in the %pagesources hash etc. But using the `will_render` mechanism assures that they will be removed when they are no longer needed.

2. create new pages which each have a report directive which shows a subset of the full result; add them to revision control, treat them as full pages.  Problems with this are: (a) trying to figure out when to create these new pages and when not to, (b) whether or not these pages can be deleted automatically.

3. some other approach I haven't thought of.

I'm afraid that whatever approach I take, it will end up being a kludge.
