I extended the functionality of the [ikiwiki-nav plugin](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2968)
(see [[here|tips/vim_ikiwiki_ftplugin]]) to allow completion of
wikilinks from inside vim, through the omnicompletion mechanism.

It still has some bugs, but is usable, and will not destroy your data. It can
only complete links whose definition (text) is on a single line, and still can't
handle "named links" (`\[\[text|link\]\]`).

I'd love to hear suggestions for improvement for it, and bug reports ;) For
example, regarding how are sorted and presented the available completions
(dates, alphabetically, etc).

You can find a tarball for it
[here](http://devnull.li/~jerojasro/ikiwiki-nav-dev.tar.gz). To install it,
extract the tarball contents in your `.vim` directory.
