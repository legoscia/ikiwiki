I've done a plugin, but I haven't done a CGI one yet. I can probably handle it though. I have a little javascript, I could probably do that too.

I'm fuzzy on the log in bit, I don't know how to bring up a log in page in IkiWiki (that would just return to the calling page and not an edit page). 

If I were going to do this I'd want to have a log out button appear when the user is logged in. Is it possible to add a log out function to the same plugin?
