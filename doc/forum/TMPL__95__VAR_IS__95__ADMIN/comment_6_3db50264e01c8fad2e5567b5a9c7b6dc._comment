> I'm fuzzy on the log in bit, I don't know how to bring up a log in page in IkiWiki

Cheap hack: make a link to `cgiurl(do => prefs)` and the user will have
to press Back a couple of times when they've logged in :-)

Less-cheap hack: have a CGI plugin that responds to `do=login` by doing
basically the same thing as `IkiWiki::needsignin`, but instead of
returning to the `QUERY_STRING`, return to the HTTP referer, or
a page whose name is passed in the query string, or some such.

I don't see why not; you could create it from Javascript for logged-in
users only. That'd close the bug [[bugs/logout in ikiwiki]] (see that
bug for related ideas).
