This isn't possible without out-of-band mechanisms (Javascript or something).
ikiwiki produces static HTML; template variables are evaluated when the HTML
is compiled, and admins and non-admins see the exact same file.

(More precisely, URLs containing `/ikiwiki.cgi/` are dynamically-generated
pages; everything else is static.)
