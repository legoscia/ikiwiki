Ok, I think I get it. The template is used when IkiWiki is compiling the static pages, then users access the static pages. So at the time the templates are compiled there isn't a concept of who is accessing the page or what their session may be like (be it admin or anon or whatever). 

Is there a simple way to serve a different static page based on session information? Off the top of my head I would say no but I thought I would ask. I suppose I could try to compile two static sites, one for me and one for the world. That would solve my IS_ADMIN problem, but I don't think its a solution for similar types of things. 

I like ikiwiki for what it is, I get the feeling I may be asking it to do something it wasn't meant to do. If so I'd appreciate it if someone told me to stop trying. [[users/justint]]
