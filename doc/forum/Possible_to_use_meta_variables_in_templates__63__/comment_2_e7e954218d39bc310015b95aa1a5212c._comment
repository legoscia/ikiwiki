Thanks for the quick response!  I'm trying to figure out some way that I can reference meta variables inside of a page.  Specifically I'm trying to create an attribution box which lists all of the information I have about who wrote the page, where the original can be found etc.  I can just pass the values to the template, but it would be really nice not have to put this information in for the meta plugin and my attribution box!

The changes you suggest sound wonderful but are beyond my abilities right row.  Any ideas how I might accomplish this in the mean time?
