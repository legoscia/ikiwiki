smcv, sorry I don't understand?  How are you getting the \[[!meta] to work on a template page, I thought that's what you said didn't work?  Do you mean a pagetemplate?

kerravonsen, thanks for the pointer I'll check those out.

I realised last night that I think I could also do this with a pagetemplate, since I should be able to access meta variables there.   A little clumsy for what I want to do but should hopefully work fine.  Would be really neat with the [section template](http://ikiwiki.info/todo/Set_templates_for_whole_sections_of_the_site/) plugin, I'll have to look at that.
