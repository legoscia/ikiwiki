This isn't supported, because [[ikiwiki/directive/template]] templates
don't run `pagetemplate` hooks (which is how information gets from
[[ikiwiki/directive/meta]] into, for instance, `page.tmpl`). The only
inputs to the `HTML::Template` are the parameters passed to the
directive, plus the `raw_`-prefixed versions of those, plus the extra
parameters passed to every `preprocess` hook (currently `page`, `destpage`
and `preview`).

I think having `pagetemplate` hooks run for this sort of template
by default would be rather astonishing, but perhaps some sort of
opt-in while defining the template would be reasonable? One problem
with that is that the templates used by [[ikiwiki/directive/template]]
are just wiki pages, and don't really have any special syntax support.
