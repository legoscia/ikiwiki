I'm trying to create a [[!iki plugins/template desc=template]] which references variables from the [[!iki plugins/meta desc=meta]] plugin, but either it's not supported or I'm doing something wrong.  This is what my template looks like:

    <div class="attributionbox">
    <p><b>Written by:</b> <a href="<TMPL_VAR AUTHORURL>"><TMPL_VAR AUTHOR></a></p>
    <p><TMPL_VAR text></b></p>
    </div>

The template is working because I get the content, but all the places where I reference meta variables are blank.  Is this supposed to work or am I trying to do something unsupported?  Many thanks for any pointers.

Cheers,
