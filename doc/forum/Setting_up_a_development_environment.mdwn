Hi,

I'm trying to setup a development environment to hack on the comments plugin and I'm having problems getting my Ikiwiki CGI to use my git checkout as the libdir and templatedir instead of the system one.

My <tt>.setup</tt> contains:

        srcdir => '/home/francois/wiki/testblog',
        destdir => '/var/www/testblog',
        url => 'http://localhost/testblog',
        cgiurl => 'http://localhost/testblog/ikiwiki.cgi',
        cgi_wrapper => '/var/www/testblog/ikiwiki.cgi',
        templatedir => '/home/francois/devel/remote/ikiwiki/templates',
        underlaydir => '/home/francois/devel/remote/ikiwiki/doc',
        libdir => '/home/francois/devel/remote/ikiwiki',
        ENV => {},
        git_wrapper => '/home/francois/wiki/testblog.git/hooks/post-update',

Now, if I modify <tt>~/devel/remote/ikiwiki/templates/comment.tmpl</tt>, my changes don't appear when I add a comment to a blog post. On the other hand, if I hack <tt>/usr/share/ikiwiki/templates/comment.tmpl</tt> and cause the page to be rebuilt by adding a new comment then that does have an effect.

The same is true for <tt>~/devel/remote/ikiwiki/Ikiwiki/Plugin/comments.pm</tt> (doesn't appear to be used) and <tt>/usr/share/perl5/Ikiwiki/Plugin/comments.pm</tt> (my hacks affect pages as they are recompiled).

I must be missing something obvious, but the [[ikiwiki development environment tips]] didn't help me...

Cheers,
