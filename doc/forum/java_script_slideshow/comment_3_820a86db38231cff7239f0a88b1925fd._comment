Well, surprise, I tried a different approach and this time it worked perfectly. So, how I did it?...

I created externally a html file with the slid-show I wanted and then put it (along with the javascript files and the images) in the source directory. I rebuilt the wiki and then inlined that html page in the wiki page where I wanted the slide-show. 

So, from now on my wiki will look like any wordpress or drupal eye-candy website but without all that bloat.

Short outline:

- put the slid-show files in the source directory
- rebuild the wiki
- on the wiki page you want some eye-candy inline the html page that contains the slid-show
- that's it ;)
