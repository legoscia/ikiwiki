Do custom [[themes]] have to live outside of the wiki (eg. `/usr/share/ikiwiki/themes/`) or is there a way for them to live inside of the wiki srcdir?  

I haven't been able to find a way so for now I'm just using a symlink, but that's a bit ugly.

I ask because I do most of my ikiwiki work on my laptop and then push changes to my server.  It's not a big deal but it's annoying to have to sync the themes separately and it seems like something which should be able to live inside the wiki like templates.
