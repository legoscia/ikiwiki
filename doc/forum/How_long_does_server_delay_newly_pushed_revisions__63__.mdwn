So I 

1. checked out the repository of the my Ikiwiki instance and added new page and editted existing pages in the working copy
2. Then add and commit the revisions: `git add .` and `git commit -m "update"`
3. Then push it to server: `git push`

I then go to browser and go to the Ikiwiki URL of recent changes. I didn't find the new revision, neither I can open the new pages.
Is there a way to verify my revision did go in? How long does the server delays processing it?
