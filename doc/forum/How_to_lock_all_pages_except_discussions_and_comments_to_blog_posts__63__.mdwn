I enabled `comments`, `lockedit` plugins. I put blog posts in `~/foobar.com/static/blog/` and other pages in `~/foobar.com/static/`. I want to 

* allow Wiki-style `Discussion` to my pages outside of `blog`
* allow blog-style comment to my blog posts
* lock all pages that's not comment or discussion

How to achieve this?

Is it `locked_pages => '!blog/comment_* and !*/Discussion'` for `lockedit` plugin, right?
