My server got hacked by an EXIM vulnerability, and so I reimaged the system.  After installing ikiwiki I can't get it to accept my old setup file, and I'm not sure what to do.  

I'm running debian stable with security updates. Running setup I get.
Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/Setup/Standard.pm line 33.
That line in the source file has something todo with wrappers.  Also since the reinstall there is no /etc/ikiwiki/auto.setup

After futzing with it for over an hour I tried installing the debian backports version, and get a new different error.

Can't exec "git": No such file or directory at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/Plugin/git.pm line 169.
Cannot exec 'git pull origin': No such file or directory
'git pull origin' failed:  at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/Plugin/git.pm line 195.

'git log --max-count=100 --pretty=raw --raw --abbrev=40 --always -c -r HEAD -- .' failed: 

Any ideas how I can get ikiwiki working again?
