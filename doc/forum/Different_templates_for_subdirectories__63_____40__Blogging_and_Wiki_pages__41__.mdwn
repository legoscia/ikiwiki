I have been mucking about with ikiwiki for two whole days now. 

I like many things about it. Even though I've been spending most of my time wrestling with css I did manage to write a whole lot of blog posts and love what ikiwiki is doing for the "revise" part of my writing cycle. And I like the idea of integrating the wiki and the blog into one unifying architecture....

But... I would like very much to have different page templates for blogging and wiki-ing, some way of specifying that for stuff in the "/posts" directory I'd rather use blogpost.tmpl rather than page.tmpl. I just spent a few minutes looking at the perl for this (I assume Render.pm) and my mind dumped core...

(generically, some way to specify output formatting on a subdirectory basis would be good)
