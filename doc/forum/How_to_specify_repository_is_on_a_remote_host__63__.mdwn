I'm new to ikiwiki and I'm trying to install it and set it up.  I've read the documentation but I still don't understand how access to the repository works.  We want ikiwiki to run on one machine but we want the repository to be on a separate machine running svn.  How can I configure ikiwiki to access the repository on the remote machine?  And how is authentication on the remote host handled in ikiwiki?  Does there have to be a one-to-one correspondence between account names (and passwords) on the ikiwiki machine and the accounts on the svn machine?  Thanks,

Eric
