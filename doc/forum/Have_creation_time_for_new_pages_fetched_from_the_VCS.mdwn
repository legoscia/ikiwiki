I use ikiwiki for my blog, and I'd like the creation page of each page to be the one registered in the VCS.  However, the only way to get that is really with the --gettime flag, which gets ALL the timestamps from the VCS...  which take quite some time after a few years of writing ;-)

So I'd like to suggest that ikiwiki could fetch ctime through rcs_getctime() by default when it finds a new page...

mtime is a different matter, not so important to me...
