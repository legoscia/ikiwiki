Hi People,

first thanks for this nice an usable piece of software.

Recently i moved to a new server, reinstalled ikiwiki via aptitude and now i'm getting this error:

    ikiwiki -setup /etc/ikiwiki/auto.setup
    /etc/ikiwiki/auto.setup: Can't locate IkiWiki/Setup/Automator.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /etc/perl /usr/local/lib/perl/5.10.0 /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.0        /usr/lib/perl5 /usr/share/perl5 /usr/lib/perl/5.10 /usr/share/perl/5.10 /usr/local/lib/site_perl .) at (eval 10) line 13.

Or with an existing wiki:

    ikiwiki -setup younameit.setup 
    younameit.setup: Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/Setup/Standard.pm line 33.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 10) line 293.

Can you help?

Best wishes,
Tobias.
