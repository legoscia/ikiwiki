Yes, mathjax works with ikiwiki. The main trouble I ran into was markdown trying to parse the math. For example markdown and tex both use underscores. I wrote a quick plugin to replace all the TeX with strip markers in the 'filter' phase and put it back in the 'sanitize' phase (just replacing all the TeX content with its Base64 representation temporarily) and that seems to have fixed the problem well enough.
