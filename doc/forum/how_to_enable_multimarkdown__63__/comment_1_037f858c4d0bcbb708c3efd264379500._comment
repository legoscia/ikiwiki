multimarkdown-git is a package build that fetches the git version of multimarkdown.
It should install Text::Markdown I believe.
I tried to install it by hand on the cpan command line but it didn't work either:
perl -MCPAN -e shell 
install Text::MultiMarkdown

says couldn't run make file or something.
