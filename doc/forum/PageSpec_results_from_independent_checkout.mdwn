I'd like to be able to do PageSpec matches independent of the Ikiwiki checkout, but at best I'm currently restricted to copying over and using whatever is in the indexdb with this approach:

    perl -MIkiWiki -le '$config{wikistatedir}=".ikiwiki"; IkiWiki::loadindex(); print foreach pagespec_match_list("", shift)' "bugs/*"

I get the impression there's a way to build up enough state to run pagespec matches without doing any rendering, but I don't know how. Any ideas? -- JoeRayhawk
