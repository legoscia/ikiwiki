Dear ikiwiki users, and specially [[users/KathrynAndersen]] ([[users/rubykat]]):
have you considered some way of extending ikiwiki to allow some kind of
on-the-fly generation of web forms to create new pages? these web forms should
offer as many fields as one has defined in some [[page
template|plugins/contrib/ftemplate]], and, once POSTed, should create a page
using that template, with those fields already filled with the values the user
provided.

I see this a a generalization of the `postform` option of the
[[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] directive. That option tells ikiwiki to create a
form with one field already filled (title).

What are your ideas about this?
