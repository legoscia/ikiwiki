Hi,

I'm wondering how is TITLE evaluated in inline archive templates?

Needless to say, I don't know much perl except the code that looks similar to other languages like bash.

I found this line:

$template->param(title => pagetitle(basename($page)));

It seems to return a page name (pagetitle having no effect). Or maybe I'm not testing this the right way!
