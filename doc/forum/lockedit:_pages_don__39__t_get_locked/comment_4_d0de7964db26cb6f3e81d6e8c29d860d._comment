    locked_pages => 'todo and todo/done and index and ikiwiki/*',

I didn't spot it before, but this is wrong: you want \"or\"
instead of \"and\".

It's a condition under which pages are to be locked: you're trying
to lock all pages that are simultaneously todo, todo/done and some
other names, which is an impossible condition to satisfy, so nothing
is locked!
