[[plugins/anonok]] might take precedence over [[plugins/lockedit]] (it depends
which gets loaded first). You should change `anonok_pagespec` to not cover the
`locked_pages`.

(It might be better if [[plugins/lockedit]] always applied first, though;
except then it'd interfere with [[plugins/opendiscussion]], so maybe
[[plugins/opendiscussion]] should apply first of all...)
