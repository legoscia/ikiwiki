as in title, how to align text to the right?

> Add to your local.css a class that aligns text to the right:

	.alignright { text-align: right; }

> And then you just just use `<span class="alignright">` around
> other html.
> 
> You can refine that, and allow right-aligning markdowned text
> by using the [[ikiwiki/directive/template]]
> directive, with a template that contains the html. The 
> [[templates/note]] template does something similar. --[[Joey]]

>> Thanks!
