You can do what you want with the [[ikiwiki/directive/pagetemplate]] directive, but in a slightly cumbersome way, because you have to say what template you want in every page that differs from the default.

See also: [[templates]]

And, a perhaps more proper solution to your problem, although I don't fully understand the way of tackling it, in [[todo/multiple_template_directories]].

If you could create a proper page in this wiki, centralizing all the knowledge dispersed in those pages, it would be nice ;)
