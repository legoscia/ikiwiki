After installing and setting up Ikiwiki on my Debian server. I somehow got the following error when trying to edit index page in browser / online:

    Not Found

    The requested URL /foobar.com/static/ikiwiki.cgi was not found on this server.

    Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.


My `foobar.setup` has the following for CGI configuration

    cgiurl => 'http:/foobar.com/static/ikiwiki.cgi',                                                                                                                          
    cgi_wrapper => '/home/foobaruser/foobar.com/static/ikiwiki.cgi',


What could be wrong?
