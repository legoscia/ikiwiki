Hi folks, I created a simple wiki to keep notes and references for projects, it's worked quite nice so far.  I decided to use git as it's what I use daily to manage code, and it's available on all my machines.

Anyway, I wanted to move all the wiki source stuff into a subfolder so that it stops cluttering up my ~ directory.  However, there seems to be a problem with moving wiki.git (I moved wiki, wiki.git and wiki.setup) and I'm not sure where to tell ikiwiki that the git directory has been moved.  I changed 

    srcdir => '/home/pixel/.notebook/wiki',
    git_wrapper => '/home/pixel/.notebook/wiki.git/hooks/post-update',

and that seems to be fine.  However when I go to run ikiwiki --setup things go wrong:

    pixel@tosh: [~ (ruby-1.9.2-p0)] âž” ikiwiki -setup .notebook/wiki.setup 
    successfully generated /home/pixel/public_html/wiki/ikiwiki.cgi
    successfully generated /home/pixel/.notebook/wiki.git/hooks/post-update
    fatal: '/home/pixel/wiki.git' does not appear to be a git repository
    fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
    'git pull origin' failed:  at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/Plugin/git.pm line 193.

I've gone through wiki.setup and nothing has jumped out as the place to set this, have I missed something?
