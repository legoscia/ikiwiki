[Flowplayer](http://flowplayer.org) is the open source flash video player plugin. [My site](http://mcfrisk.kapsi.fi) has raw html enabled to work with old content so I was able to use the raw html and javascript [examples](http://flowplayer.org/documentation/installation/index.html) in blog posts, but some of them fail when combined on the [aggregate page](http://mcfrisk.kapsi.fi/skiing/). Any hints on how to properly use Flowplayer with ikiwiki?
