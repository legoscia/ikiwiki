I just tried to lock some pages via the [[plugins/lockedit]] plugin in my wiki but it does not work. Not any page I've tried gets locked. Here's a snipped of my setup:

    add_plugins => [qw{goodstuff edittemplate filecheck getsource htmltidy recentchanges relativedate rename remove search sidebar po httpauth attachment img 404 inline localstyle pagestats progress orphans map toc brokenlinks autoindex anonok blogspam recentchangesdiff}],
    disable_plugins => [qw{smiley openid theme}],
    [...]
    anonok_pagespec => '*',
    [...]
    locked_pages => 'todo and todo/done and index and ikiwiki/*',

Is there an interference between anonok and lockedit or is there just a typo?

I can't imagine another source of the problem. Hope you can help me. --[[bacuh]]
