I just realized I blew away my outward-facing git repos and setup when I blew away the site.  augh.  It'll take more time than I have to fix that right now.

Current git repo is over dumb http at http://lovesgoodfood.com/jason.git until I can fix the rest.  And two necessary extra plugins are at http://lovesgoodfood.com/htmlpage.pm and http://lovesgoodfood.com/imgcss.pm .  Haven't cleaned / documented them enough to contribute.  They shouldn't interfere with the tag plugin.  I'll be up your way this weekend, except on a super-slow satellite link so won't be able to play much on-line.  Might be able to debug locally.

If you get a change to poke, I'd be grateful, but there's plenty else to do. ;)  Morels should be up...
