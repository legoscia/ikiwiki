So, I don't see the issue of only one of the two capitalizations of a tag being updated when a page is added.

Both caps of the tag were updated there. I do see some evidence of your site being updated by ikiwiki running with possibly different configuration. Compare date formats used on <http://lovesgoodfood.com/jason/tags/NaPoWriMo/> and <http://lovesgoodfood.com/jason/tags/napowrimo/>. Now, that could just be a different LANG setting, but if the configuration different goes deeper, it could point toward an explanation of the inconsistency of only one case of a tag being updated to list a page.. possibly.

I can reproduce tag autocreation creating multiple tag pages that differ only in case. That's a bug, fixed in bad5072c02d506b5b5a0d74cd60639f7f62cc7d3.

AFAICS, you don't have `tag_autocreate_commit` set to false, so transient tags are not being used.
