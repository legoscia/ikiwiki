I have a bunch of tag pages autogenerated by the tag plugin. As part of a redesign for my wiki, I have changed the `autotag.tmpl` template, but IkiWiki refuses to rebuild existing tag pages using the updated template. I understand that existing tag pages are not rebuilt because they have been marked as "created" in `.ikiwiki/indexdb`. Is there a way to purge all tag pages from `indexdb`? --dkobozev

>> Thanks. I thought about deleting `indexdb`, but hesitated to do that. According to [[tips/inside dot ikiwiki]], `indexdb` stores "all persistent state about pages". I didn't know if it's harmless to lose all persistent state. --dkobozev
