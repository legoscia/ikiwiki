This is what the [[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] directive is for. It's often used, to for example, show new posts to a blog. If you want to show new posts to anywhere in your site, or whatever, you can configure the [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] in it to do that, too. 

For example, you could use this:

    The most recent 3 pages added to this site:
    \[[!inline pages=\"*\" archive=yes show=4]]
"""]]
