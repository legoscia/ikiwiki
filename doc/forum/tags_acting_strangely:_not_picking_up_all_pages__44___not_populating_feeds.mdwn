Ok, I'm confused.  See http://lovesgoodfood.com/jason/tags/napowrimo/ and
http://lovesgoodfood.com/jason/tags/NaPoWriMo/ for two examples of not
picking up pages quite right.  I didn't realize that tags are randomly
case-sensitive while still capitalized in the output title?  See the list
of backlinks on each.  Also, the only pages actually being ''listed'' are
from a year ago, but the backlinks include current pages.  The posts
''are'' being included on http://lovesgoodfood.com/jason/tags/poetry/ .
The feeds are populated on my host, but not on my laptop (Debian
unstable-ish, as opposed to a git pull on my host).

Halp?  I've blown away the old (including .ikiwiki) and rebuilt to no
effect.  The tag pages are meant to be transients (loaded by default,
according to the docs?), but they're still being created.  Nothing seems
quite correct.
