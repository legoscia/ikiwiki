Hi! I am searching for a replacement of my blog and webpages made off static HTML with just some custom PHP around it for years already. ikiwiki seems to be one of the hot candidates, since it uses a RCS.

I would like to have a multi domain setup like this:

- myname.private.de => more of a personal page
- professional.de => more of my professional work related page
- and possibly others

Now when I write a blog entry about some Linux, Debian or KDE stuff, I possibly would like to have it shown on my private and my professional domain.

And I might like to use some kind of inter wiki links now and then.

Is such a setup possible? I thought about have a big wiki with Apache serving sub directories from it under different domains, but then wiki links like would not work.

Maybe having the same blog entry, same content on several domains is not such a hot idea, but as long as I do not see a problem with it, I'd like to do it.
