Well, your cgiurl is an invalid url (valid urls start with \"http://\" , not \"http:/\")

Perhaps you also have a misconfigured web server. You don't say if `/home/foobaruser/foobar.com/` is configured to be served up for foobar.com. Or perhaps you need to follow the instructions in [[tips/dot_cgi]].

Or, perhaps `/home/foobaruser/foobar.com/static/ikiwiki.cgi` does not exist; did you run ikiwiki -setup?
