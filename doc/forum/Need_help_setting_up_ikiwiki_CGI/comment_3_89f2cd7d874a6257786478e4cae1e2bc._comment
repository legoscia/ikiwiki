After testing using a test CGI script (thanks to smcv), I confirmed this is not a problem of the server not being set up to serve CGI. I then tried changing the permissions of `ikiwiki.cgi` and found:

* on the remote server, if I have `-rwsr-sr-x` for `ikiwiki.cgi`, the CGI features such as `Preference` and `Edit` buttons don't work, but if I set it `-rwsr-xr-x`, it works. The server is a Debian VPS.

* in contrast, on my local LAMP server `localhost`, both permissions work

Any ideas?

Thanks!
