I discovered that I not only needed to change the regexp, but I also needed to delete .ikiwiki/indexdb because `file_pruned` only gets called for files that aren't in the `%pagesources` hash, and since the file in question was already there because it had been put there before the exclude regex was changed, it wasn't even being checked!
