It looks as though you might only be excluding a top-level Makefile, and not a Makefile in subdirectories. Try excluding `(^|/)Makefile$` instead, for instance? (See `wiki_file_prune_regexps` in `IkiWiki.pm` for hints.)

The match operation in `&file_pruned` ends up a bit like this:

    \"foo/Makefile\" =~ m{…|…|…|(^|/)Makefile$}
