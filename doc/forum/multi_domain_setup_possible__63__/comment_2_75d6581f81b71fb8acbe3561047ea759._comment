So I I just put a blog entry, which is just a file on both branches. Seems I have to learn cherry-picking and merging only some changes.

Still I am duplicating files then and when I edit one file I have to think to also edit the other one or merge the change to it. I thought of a way to tag a blog entry on which site it should appear. And then I just have to edit one file and contents changes on all sites that share it.

But then I possibly can do some master blog / shared content branch, so that shared content is only stored once. Then I need to find a way to automatically replicate the changes there to all sites it belongs too. But how do I store it.

I also thought about just using symlinks for files. Can I have two sites in one repository and symlink shared files stuff around? I know bzr can version control symlinks.

Hmmm, I think I better read more about branching, cherry-picking and merging before I proceed. I used bzr and git, but from the user interface side of things prefer bzr, which should be fast enough for this use case.
