This is where the git backend (or bzr if you prefer) shines. Make a site, and then branch it to a second site, and put your personal type stuff on the branch. cherry-pick or merge changes from one branch to another.

The possibility to do this kind of thing is why our recently launched Ikiwiki hosting service is called
[Branchable.com](http://branchable.com). It makes it easy to create branches of a Ikiwiki site hosted
there: <http://www.branchable.com/tips/branching_an_existing_site/> 
(Merging between branches need manual git, for now.)

BTW, for links between the branched wikis you can just use the [[plugins/shortcut]] plugin.
