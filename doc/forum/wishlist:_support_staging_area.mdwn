It would be nice if ikiwiki had built-in support for a staging area.

Default branch name would be *staging*, default result path would be *staging* as well.

Thus, if I push into the staging branch, it should automagically create a full copy of the site in staging/ .

This would make playing with ikiwiki easier while not cluttering the main branch and site.

A simple .htaccess would take care of keeping the staging are limited to people who should be allowed to access it.
