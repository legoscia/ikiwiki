Hey there!

I'm trying to get the translated version of basewiki activated in my wiki. Setting "locale => 'de_DE.UTF-8'" gave me some german messages on the CLI and a few changes in the wiki itself but the basewiki is still english. The files in /usr/share/ikiwiki/po/de/ are there.

As I understand, [[plugins/po]] is just for translating.

So, what am I doing wrong?
