I'm Øyvind A. Holm, a Norwegian guy who's been in love with \*NIX-like operating systems since I first tried [QNX](http://www.qnx.com/) in 1987.
Then, after playing around with [Coherent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_%28operating_system%29) for a while, I finally got on the Linux bandwagon at kernel 1.2.8 in 1995.

I live in Bergen, Norway, at [N 60.37436° E 5.3471°](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=60.374252&mlon=5.34722&zoom=16&layers=M), to be specific.
I'm quite passionate about Open Source in general, freedom of speech, music and science.
I'm a photo enthusiast, musician now and then, atheist and some kind of anarchist.

Most of the places on the Net I hang around are listed on my [Google profile](http://www.google.com/profiles/sunny256).

I discovered ikiwiki on 2011-02-15, and immediately clicked with it.
One week later it had replaced everything on [my web server](http://www.sunbase.org), after using some homegrown CMS written in Perl for years, [Mediawiki](http://www.mediawiki.org), [Drupal](http://drupal.org) and whatnot.
Seems as I've found the perfect system at last.
Thanks for creating it, Joey.

I have a clone of the ikiwiki repository at <https://github.com/sunny256/ikiwiki> where patches go.
