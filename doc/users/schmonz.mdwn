[Amitai Schlair](http://www.netbsd.org/~schmonz/) recently discovered ikiwiki and finds himself using it for all sorts of things. His attempts at contributing:

[[!map pages="!*/Discussion and ((link(users/schmonz) and plugins/*) or rcs/cvs)"]]

I've also written a plugin for [WIND authentication](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/rad/authmethods/wind/), which may or may not be of general utility.
