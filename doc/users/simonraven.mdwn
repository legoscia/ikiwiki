## personal/site info

Have several ikiwiki-based sites at my web site, blog, kisikew.org home site, for indigenews, and our indigenous-centric wiki (mostly East Coast/Woodlands area).
## ikiwiki branch at github

Maintain my own branch, partly to learn about VCS, git, ikiwiki, Debian packaging, and Perl. Thinking of removing most 3rd-party plugins (found in contrib/). Have some custom plugins to support dual bottom-of-the-page "sidebars" and an attempt at supporting HTTPBL (see projecthoneypot.org).
