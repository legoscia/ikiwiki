I am a Ph. D. student at the Knowledge Media Institute of The Open University, UK.  I'm also on the board of directors of [PlanetMath.org](http://planetmath.org), and a contributor to the [Planetary](http://trac.mathweb.org/planetary) project where we are rebuilding PlanetMath's backend (features will include some with significant inspiration from ikiwiki).
