"There is one optional keyword argument, `generated`.  Normally the "
"`listdirectives` directive will list all built in directives and directives "
"directly registered by plugins.  With this keyword, `listdirectives` will "

"directives generated in turn by the `shortcut` directive.  They will only be "
