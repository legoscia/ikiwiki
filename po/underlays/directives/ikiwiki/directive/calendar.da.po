"The calendar is essentially a fancy front end to archives of previous pages, "
"usually used for blogs. It can produce a calendar for a given month, or a "
"list of months for a given year. The month format calendar simply links to "
"any page posted on each day of the month. The year format calendar links to "
"archive pages, with names like `archives/2007` (for all of 2007)  and "
"`archives/2007/01` (for January, 2007)."
