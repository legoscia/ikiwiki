"unmapped pages will be omitted. If the pages to include are not specified, "
"the links between all pages (and other files) in the wiki are mapped. For "
"best results, only a small set of pages should be mapped, since otherwise "
"the map can become very large, unwieldy, and complicated. Also, the map is "
"rebuilt whenever one of the mapped pages is changed, which can make the wiki "
"a bit slow."
